# top-n

## Requirements:

- Ruby >= 2.2.1
- Rake

You might need to install the gem _test-unit_ in order to run the unit tests:
```
gem install test-unit
```

## How to use it:

In order to run the top-n, from the root dir of this project, type:
```
./bin/top-n FILE_PATH NUMBER
```
where:
* FILE_PATH is the path of the input file
* NUMBER corresponds to the 'N' from the top-n computation 

You can also play with the unit tests if you desire. In order to run the tests, type:
```
rake test
```
